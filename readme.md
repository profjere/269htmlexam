<h1>HTML/CSS Exam</h1>
<h2>COMM 269: Web Design</h2>

<b>Type the answers to question #1-10 on a Word Document.  #13 requires you to add a URL to the same Word document.</b>
You can download all of these files at once by choosing download in the upper right corner.

1)	What is the function of the <title> tag?

2)	What are two advantages in keeping CSS rules in a separate file?

3)	What color is #9365A8?

4)	Why might you choose to use <b>main</b> rather than <b>div id=”main”</b>? 

5)	In designing a layout, why would you choose Grid Layout vs. Flexbox?

6)	Consider: <b>background-size: contain</b> and <b>background-size: cover</b>. Explain how these differ.

7)	What two lines of code placed on the CSS page are necessary to make all h1 tags on the attached HTML page display with the font: Roboto Slab (from Google Fonts.)  Assume there are no additional tags overriding the general rule for h1.

8)	What is the HTML to create a link to the St. John Fisher homepage with the words: St. John Fisher College?  

9)	Explain how to position a line of text at exactly 15px from the left and 25 pixels from the bottom of a specific div.  What CSS code is needed and explain how it works.

10)	On the server, if you create an images folder in the same folder as an index.html file and place an image (bird.jpg) inside the images folder, what is the html code (with no CSS needed) to make the image appear on index.html and also make sure that it is accessible for individuals with vision problems.

11)	Identify five errors in the HTML marked: debugme.html (see files above).  Assume all the text in black is correct.  Fix the errors right in the code.

12)	Please comment in the 8 blank comment lines on comment.css (see files above) to explain how the CSS page functions.

13)	Create the page seen with four different screen widths in the four png (specifically: example1, example2, example3, example4).  Click on the download button after opening each image to see it in its entirety.  The four images represent one page at different sizes so just create one HTML and one CSS page.  The images are available in the above Github.  They do not need to be transformed in any way in Photoshop.  Place the finished page in your webserver and place the link on the sheet in which you answer questions #1-10.  


•	Create a zip file with three files:

a)	the Word document in which you answer the questions #1-#10 and provide the link to the solution to question #13.  

b)	The fixed debugme.html 

c)	The fully commented comment.css
