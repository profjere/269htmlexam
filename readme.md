1)	What is the function of the <title> tag?

4)	Why might you choose to use <main> rather than <div id=”main”>? 

5)	In designing a layout, why would you choose Grid Layout vs. Flexbox?

6)	Consider: background-size: contain and background-size: cover. Explain in writing or through writing and a drawing, how these differ.

7)	What two lines of code placed on the CSS page are necessary to make all h1 tags on the attached HTML page display with the font: Roboto Slab (from Google Fonts.)  Assume there are no additional tags overriding the general rule for h1.

8)	What is the HTML to create a link to the St. John Fisher homepage with the words: St. John Fisher College?  

9)	Explain how to position a line of text at exactly 15px from the left and 25 pixels from the bottom of a specific div.  What CSS code is needed, and explain how it works.

10)	If you create an images folder next to an index.html file and place an image (bird.jpg) inside the folder, what is the html code (with no CSS needed) to make the image appear on index.html so that it is also accessible for individuals with vision problems.

11)	Identify five errors in the HTML marked: debugme.html.  Assume all the text in black is correct.  Fix the errors right in the code.

12)	Please comment in the 8 blank comment lines on comment.css to explain how the CSS page functions.

13)	Create the page seen with four different screen widths in the four png (example1, example2, example3, example4).  This is just one page (so just create one HTML and one CSS page).  The images are available in the above Github.  They do not need to be transformed in any way in Photoshop.  Place the finished page in your webserver and place the link on the sheet in which you answer questions #1-10.  


•	Create a zip file with three files:

a)	the Word document in which you answer the questions #1-#10 and provide the link to the solution to question #13.  

b)	The fixed debugme.html 

c)	The fully commented comment.css
